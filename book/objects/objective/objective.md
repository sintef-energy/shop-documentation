(objective)=
# objective
An object to hold the information of the objective function after optimization. These objects are automatically created by SHOP, one objective object per scenario is created with the name 'scen_<number>'. In addition, the average objective weighted by the scenario probablities is created in every SHOP run. For a regular deterministic SHOP run, the average_objective and scen_1 objective will be identical.
