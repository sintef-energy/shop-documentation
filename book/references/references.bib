   abstract = {The paper addresses the challenges of short-term hydropower scheduling in a liberalized power system. Hydropower systems may have quite complex topologies with many cascaded reservoirs/power plants in the same river system. The reservoirs may have very different storage capacity with significant water travel time that makes the decisions coupled between several time steps. In other words, the decisions in one time interval have strong impact on what's possible to do in later time steps. In systems where some of the reservoirs have significant storage capacity, the use of the hydropower resources short-term will be coupled with the long-term strategic decisions. It is not feasible to have the short-term decisions within the same model as the long-term decisions because modeling of uncertainty is important. The problem is decomposed into a planning hierarchy where the long/mid-term models provide boundary conditions for the short-term models. The major items of this paper are: challenges and possible solutions in hydro system modeling, a flexible coupling principle between short-term and mid-term scheduling, strategies for bidding in a spot market.},

However, the lifetime is limited, and cycling depth affects the battery degradation rate. Current stochastic multi-stage methods lack proper representation of battery degradation. This paper proposes a stochastic multi-stage model for optimizing battery operation in a microgrid considering battery degradation with a piece-wise linear cost function with uncertain wind power production and load. The model is solved using Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) and is demonstrated on a 4-bus test case with limited import and export capacity to illustrate the battery degradation cost's impacts on the battery cycling strategy. The results show that the importance of a stochastic method is more pronounced when battery degradation is modelled.},

Battery models for optimization typically represent the battery with power and energy variables, while the voltage, current, charge variable space is used for simulation models. This paper proposes a non-linear battery storage optimization model in the voltage, current, charge variable space. The battery voltage is conceived as an empirical function of both state-of-charge and charge current and represented through bi-variate cubic splines. The voltage source converter losses are also approximated with a cubic spline function. Compared to energy-based storage models, the results show that this approach enables safe operation closer to the battery voltage and current limits. Furthermore, it prefers operating around high state-of-charge due to the higher efficiency in that region.},

   abstract = {The short-term hydro scheduling (STHS) problem aims at determining the optimal power generation schedules for either a single hydropower plant or an integrated system of cascaded watercourses during a time horizon from a single day to one week. Traditionally, an aggregated plant concept is usually adopted in the formulation of the STHS problem. The hydro-turbine generator units in a plant are aggregated as one equivalent unit. Nowadays, more and more hydro producers participate in both energy and capacity markets. It highlights the need for the precise calculation for energy conversion and available capacity of each unit. Formulating the STHS problem on individual units can accurately capture the physical and the operational characteristics of the unit. In this overview, a detailed classification of mathematical programming approaches to model and solve the unit-based STHS problem is presented. The various modeling techniques proposed in the publications since 2000 are categorized by their objectives and constraints. This provides a comprehensive comparison and discussion for each specific issue in the formulation of STHS. We anticipate this overview to be a starting point for finding more computationally solvable and effective methods to handle the challenges in the unit-based STHS problem.},

   abstract = {Optimization tools are widely used for solving the short-term hydro scheduling (STHS) problem in a cascaded hydro system. In a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based formulation, the nonlinear and non-convex hydropower production function (HPF) is represented by piecewise linear approximation. However, instead of using a set of predefined curves with static breakpoints or a preprocessing phase to define the complete relationship between the power output, the net head, and the water discharge, this paper proposes a novel method in which the breakpoints in the linearization are determined dynamically, taking into account the time-varying head effect, intake loss, penstock loss, tailrace loss, and head-dependent turbine efficiency. Only one binary variable is needed to indicate the on/off status and power generation of a unit per period. Furthermore, there are few studies available on how to represent the HPF precisely for the hydraulic system where penstocks are shared by multiple generating units. In this paper, we investigate three heuristics to explicitly incorporate the nonlinear and state-dependent power loss in shared penstocks into the STHS problem. The method and heuristics have been implemented in an operational STHS tool used by many hydropower producers in Nordic countries. We use a simple hydro system to illustrate the method and heuristics and a real hydro system in Northern Norway to study calculation efficiency and solution quality. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method can precisely represent the head-dependent and nonlinear operating characteristics of the generating units. The accurate modeling of a system with multi-level shared penstock configurations is crucial for obtaining the optimal unit commitment. The heuristics can effectively handle the power loss in shared penstock in various operating conditions.},

In contrast, standard stochastic programs involve cross-scenario equality constraints that describe the non-anticipative nature of the optimal solution. The standard progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) iteratively manipulates the objective function coefficients of the scenario subproblems to reflect the costs of non-anticipativity and penalize deviations from a non-anticipative, aggregated solution. Our proposed algorithm follows the same principle, but works with cross-scenario inequality constraints. Specifically, we focus on the problem of determining optimal bids for hydropower producers that participate in wholesale electricity auctions. The cross-scenario inequality constraints arise from the fact that bids are required to be non-decreasing. We show that PHA for inequality constraints have the same convergence properties as standard PHA, and illustrate our algorithm with results for an instance of the hydropower bidding problem.},

   abstract = {The purpose of short-term hydropower scheduling (STHS) in a competitive electricity market is to maximize the profit in the near future while adapting to the mid-term strategies for system operation. To ensure a realistic and feasible operation for STHS, it is crucial to accurately represent the hydropower production function (HPF). The turbine efficiency can be represented by a two-dimensional table provided by the turbine manufacturers or measured by the hydropower producers on-site with some given efficiency values for a set of net water head and discharge values. In literature, the actual efficiency value for any working point is usually linearly interpolated from the given efficiency values. To the best of authors' knowledge, no study has been done so far to investigate how a nonlinear interpolation for the turbine efficiency, i.e. spline interpolation, may contribute to the application of STHS. In this paper, we compare the performance of linear interpolation and spline interpolation for turbine efficiency curves in the STHS problem and the bidding strategy in intraday market. The interpolation methods are tested on an operational hydro-power scheduling model, Short-term Hydro Optimization Program (SHOP), which is used by most large hydropower producers in the Nordic countries. Numerical tests demonstrate superior behavior of spline interpolation for the estimation of turbine efficiency between measured points. Compared to linear interpolation, spline interpolation for turbine efficiency curves gives smoother discharge transitions in day-ahead scheduling and is vital for obtaining continuous marginal cost curves in intraday trading. Based on the results in this paper, spline interpolation is a promising alternative to linear interpolation for turbine efficiency curves in STHS.},

   abstract = {When planning the production for certain hydropower plants, minimum pressure is one of the major critical points. Violation of the minimum pressure causes the power plant to automatically shut down, hence violating the obligations of the plant. Automatic pressure switches and pressure constraints are difficult to model in particular when embedded in a complex water way. This problem is expected to increase when retrofitting hydro installations with new parallel units and increased exploitation of inflow resources. From a scheduling point of view, however, such switches become hard to integrate in an optimal operation plan as the constraint depends on the system state. This paper introduces a novelty in short-term production planning, namely a solution for modelling minimum pressure height in regulated watercourses when optimizing the energy production of hydropower plants. This solution is integrated in the short-term hydropower scheduling tool SHOP. The tool finds an optimal strategy to run a power station with such minimum pressure restrictions and the state dependent topological couplings within the water system. We apply the model on a complex topology, the Sira-Kvina water system, where Norway's largest hydropower station Tonstad Kraftstajon is operationally subject to this rigorous pressure constraint. First, in order to illustrate the concepts of the model, we apply the model on a simplified water course including one reservoir. Next, the outcome and tests are demonstrated on the final model of two reservoirs whose respective outflows are joining together above the pressure gauge, as found in the Sira-Kvina water system.},

In addition to delivering energy, the fast ramping characteristics of hydropower units makes them suitable for delivery of various balancing products that are needed in order to maintain system security. The price at which these products are offered is determined by the opportunity costs in the day-ahead energy market. In a small case study, these opportunity costs are assessed by analyzing the changes from the optimal day-ahead production schedule for various types and volumes of reserve delivery commitments. We find that the requirement of delivering spinning reserves may significantly restrict the production schedule. This type of balancing service is thus found to be costly in our analysis. The special restriction of symmetric up and down regulation for primary reserves also makes this type of service more expensive as the solution space is even more restrained.},

It is crucial to coordinate the available flexible generating resources, such as hydropower, to meet the need for system balancing. However, reserved capacity on hydropower plants should only be activated if there is sufficient energy or storage capacity to either increase or decrease production. The potential change in production will also affect all reservoirs and plants connected by the cascaded topology. These issues are largely ignored or simplified in hydropower reserve scheduling models. To properly account for the possible activation of reserved capacity, several two-stage model formulations based on stochastic and robust optimization are presented and compared in this paper. The uncertainty in net load deviations due to forecasting errors in renewable power generation is considered the source of reserve capacity activation. The case study based on a real Norwegian watercourse clearly shows the benefit of using any of the two-stage model solutions over the standard deterministic reserve procurement. A novel hybrid stochastic-robust model formulation is presented and shown to efficiently increase the robustness of the solution without notably increasing the reserve procurement cost compared to the stochastic and robust models.},

We heuristically calculate the marginal cost for all the operating points, covering the entire working area for the plant and including all the physical limitations and reserve obligations in other markets. Heuristics are proposed to reduce the computation time without neglecting significant practical features. Numerical results based on a real-world case study demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in terms of computation time and solution quality.},

   abstract = {Optimization of hydroelectric power production is often executed for river systems consisting of several powerplants and reservoirs located in the same region. For hydropower stations located along the same river, the release from upstream reservoirs ends up as inflows to downstream stations. Calculating marginal cost for a string of powerplants with limited reservoir capacity between them, requires a new approach compared to heuristically calculating marginal cost for single plants in well-regulated hydrological systems. A new method, using marginal cost curves for individual powerplants to generate an overall marginal cost curve for interlinked power stations has been developed. Results based on a real-world case study demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in terms of solution quality, in addition to significant insight into how optimal load distribution should be executed in daily operations.},

The stochastic bid model sees uncertainty in both spot market prices and inflow to the reservoirs. The same simulation procedure is also implemented for a practice-based deterministic heuristic method similar to what is currently used for bid determination in the industry, and the results are compared. The stochastic approach gives improvements in terms of higher obtained average price and higher total value than the deterministic alternative. It also performs well in terms of startup costs. In the presence of river flow travel delay, the practice-based method is even more outperformed by the stochastic model. © 2014 IEEE.},

For price-taking producers, it is optimal to offer energy according to marginal costs, which for hydropower are determined by the opportunity cost of using water that could have been stored for future production. At the time of bidding, uncertainty of future prices and inflows may affect the opportunity costs and thus also the optimal bids. This paper presents a model for hydropower bidding where the bids are based on optimal production schedules from a stochastic model.

Particularly, we are interested in methods for hydropower producers that participate in multiple, sequential markets for short-term delivery of physical power. As most of the literature focus on day-ahead bidding and thermal energy producers, there are important research gaps for hydropower, which require specialized methods due to the fact that electricity may be stored as water in reservoirs. Our opinion is that multi-market participation, although reportedly having a limited profit potential, can provide gains in flexibility and system stability for hydro producers. We argue that managing uncertainty is of key importance for making good decision support tools for the multi-market bidding problem. Considering uncertainty calls for some form of stochastic programming, and we define a modelling process that consists of three interconnected tasks; mathematical modelling, electricity price forecasting and scenario generation. We survey research investigating these tasks and point out areas that are not covered by existing literature.},

In this paper, we formulate the mult-market bidding problem for power producers as a stochastic program. This formulation is implemented within the framework of optimization models used by the Nordic hydropower industry. We also present how input to the stochastic program may be generated by using a forecast-based scenario generation method combined with time-series models that predicts future prices and turnovers in the markets. The model is applied in a case study to investigate the value of participating in the Nordic day-ahead and balancing market. A producer may participate in the balancing market either by considering the markets sequentially or coordinated. Using cases with limited and perfect information about the balancing market to calculate lower and upper bounds, we find that the value of participating in the balancing market using the sequential approach is between 0.8 and 2.6%. Using the coordinated approach, the producer may gain between 1.4 and 2.9%. The value of coordination, i.e. the value of using the coordinated over the sequential approach, is found to be higher in the limited information case (1.7%) than in the perfect information case (1.1%). This indicates that, the more uncertainty, the higher is the value of coordination.},

   abstract = {A stochastic programming model for a price-taking, profit-maximizing hydropower producer participating in the Nordic day-ahead and balancing market is developed and evaluated by backtesting over 200 historical days. We find that the producer may gain 0.07% by coordinating its trades in the day-ahead and balancing market, compared to considering the two markets sequentially. It is thus questionable whether a coordinated bidding strategy is worthwhile. However, the gain from coordinating trades is dependent on the quality of the forecasts for the balancing market. The limited gain of 0.07% comes from using an artificial neural network prediction model that is trained on historical data on seasonal effects, day-ahead market price, wind and temperature forecasts. To quantify the effect of the forecasting model on the gain of coordination, we therefore develop a benchmarking framework for two additional prediction models: a naive forecast predicting zero imbalance in expectation, and a perfect information forecast. Using the naive method, we estimate the lower bound of coordination to be 0.0% which coincides with theory. When having perfect information, we find that the upper bound for the gain is 3.8% which indicates that a substantial gain in profits can be obtained by coordinated bidding if accurate prediction methods could be developed.},

By simulating the operations of the combined system for a whole year by solving daily stochastic planning and real-Time balancing problems, we show that the battery is only used when the hydropower system is under stress from large amounts of inflow and limited available storage capacity. The annual cost savings of adding the battery, including battery degradation costs, is 3, 314 €, which is low compared to the investment costs of the battery. Since the inflow to the system follows a predictable seasonal pattern, the system operator should consider renting the battery storage from external sources, such as electric vehicles, instead of investing in a permanent battery.},

To accurately represent the non-linear hydropower production function with forbidden production zones, binary variables must be used when linearizing the discharge variables and the continuity constraints on individual hydropower units must be relaxed. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed continuous-time hydrothermal model, a small-scale case study of a hydropower area connected to a thermal area through a controllable high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cable is presented. Results show how the flexibility of the hydropower can reduce the need for ramping by thermal units triggered by intermittent renewable power generation. A reduction of 34% of the structural imbalances in the system is achieved by using the continuous-time model.},

   abstract = {The increase of volatile generation from wind and solar power in Europe leads to a higher demand for flexibility in the electrical energy system. As part of the HydroBalance project this paper assesses the potential of Norwegian hydropower to provide this flexibility to the European energy markets by simulating to different scenarios for the expansion of hydropower in Norway. A comparison of the resulting cost reduction of variable system costs with necessary investment costs shows that there is an economic benefit of Norwegian hydropower to the European system especially when providing cross-border balancing.},
