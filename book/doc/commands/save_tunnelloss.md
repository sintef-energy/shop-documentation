## Printing tunnel loss in results
To save the loss in each tunnel in junctions and junction gates, use the command:
```
save tunnelloss
```

This will write the loss to the result file when results are saved with either the command save series or save xmlseries after an optimization, or save xmlshopsimseries after a simulation.
