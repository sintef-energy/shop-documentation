## Saving detailed simulation results
As for the optimization, detailed simulation results can be saved to either ascii or xml format with the commands:
```
save shopsimseries <filename.ascii>
save xmlshopsimseries <filename.xml>
```

Note that both commands are password protected by the simulation functionality, and saving the results as an xml file is also protected by the xml format functionality.
