## Saving basic optimization results
Basic [](reservoir), [](gate), [](plant) and [](market) results from the optimization may be saved to file with the command:
```
return simres (/generator) <filename.result>
```

Only plant information with the power production and discharge for individual units will be printed when using the /generator option.
