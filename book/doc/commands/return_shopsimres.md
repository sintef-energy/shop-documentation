## Saving basic simulation results
Simplified simulation results of plants, gates and reservoirs can be saved with the command:
```
return shopsimres (/generator) <filename.result>
```

Only [](plant) information with the power production and discharge for individual units will be printed when using the /generator option.

This command will terminate execution of SHOP:
```
quit
```
