## Save stochastic results (SHARM functionality)
If a stochastic SHOP run is to be saved, use the command:
```
return scenario_result_table <filename.ascii>
```

This saves the system results for all scenarios to the same file. This is only useful to participants in the SHARM project(s), since regular SHOP runs only use one scenario.
