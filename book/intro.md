# Getting started

This documentation presents an updated overview of available functionality in SHOP. Many of the functionalities are presented through examples. SHOP supports several input formats as decribed in the [introduction](interaction). For new SHOP users, the introduction example is recommended before looking into more advanced functionality. To get started coding your own models, you can either use the [vLab](https://vlab.sintef.energy) where pySHOP is preinstalled in a Jupyter based environment, or you can [download SHOP](https://shop.sintef.energy/files/shop-releases/) from the portal and install [pySHOP](https://github.com/sintef-energy/pyshop) on your local computer.

## Launching code with SHOP vlab
This documentation contains executable code examples that can be executed on the SHOP virtual lab simply by hovering ![](images/rocket.png) in the top right corner and select ![](images/jupyter-hub.png). You can try it out here and now to execute the code block below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-output"]
print("Hello SHOP!")
```

Happy coding!
