# SHOP examples and tutorials

The functionality in SHOP is presented through examples. All examples are written in python using pySHOP. For new SHOP users, the introduction example is recommended before looking into more advanced functionality. To get started coding your own models, you can either use the [vLab](https://vlab.sintef.energy) where pySHOP is preinstalled in a Jupyter based environment, or you can [download SHOP](https://shop.sintef.energy/files/shop-releases/) from the portal and install [pySHOP](https://github.com/sintef-energy/pyshop) on your local computer. Happy coding!
