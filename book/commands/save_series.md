## Saving detailed optimization results
Detailed optimization results of the system can be saved to either an ascii or xml file using these commands:
```
save series <filename.ascii>
save xmlseries <filename.xml>
```

This is the most common way to save optimization results in SHOP. Note that only the save xmlseries command is password protected by the xml format functionality.
