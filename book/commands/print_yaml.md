(print_yaml)=
# print yaml
Print yaml case. Options are independent and any combination is valid: "/input_only" turns of the printing of output/result attribute values, "compress_txy" compresses txy value by removing consecutive duplicate values and "compress_connection" omits any connection information that is not needed for reproducing the case. The case will be named "shop_yaml.yaml" unless another file name is provided
