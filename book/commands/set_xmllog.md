```

## Changing log file format
To write the log file on xml format, use the command:
```
set xmllog /<option>
```

|<option>|Comment|
|---|---|
|on|Start writing to shop_log.xml|
|off|Stop writing to shop_log.xml, and switch back to shop.log|

Note that start and end xml tags will be written each time the command is given. The `set xmllog /on` command should only be used once. If everything should be written to the xml log, it is not necessary to give the `set xmllog /off` command. Typically the `set xmllog /on` command should be given as the first command in the command file.

The change of log format can also be given as the command line option â€“xmllog.
