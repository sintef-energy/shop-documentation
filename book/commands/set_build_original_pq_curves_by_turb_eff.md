(set_build_original_pq_curves_by_turb_eff)=
# set build_original_pq_curves_by_turb_eff
When this command is turned on, only the head-dependent turb_eff_curves will be taken into account when building the original pq curve for the unit. Otherwise, all the operating limits (e.g. min_prod, time-dependent min_p_constr, time-dependent min_q_constr) are considered.
