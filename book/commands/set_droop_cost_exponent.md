# set droop_cost_exponent
Set the value to any positive number higher than 1.0 to build a convex and increasing cost curve for the droop value instead of using a linear cost. The number represents the degree of the convex polynomial used to build the cost curve, which means that a value of 2.0 results in a quadratic cost curve.
