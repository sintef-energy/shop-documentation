# Water route
The water route between reservoirs and plants can either be modelled by connecting the reservoir and plants directly or by using the different water route objects [](river), [](tunnel), [](gate), [](junction), [](creek_intake) and [](junction_gate). [River](river) and [](tunnel) are recommended to be used for future compatibility.
